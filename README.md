> I Spy... Water Safety is an interactive game designed to teach water safety.
[![Downloads Stats][npm-downloads]][npm-url]

The Game was designed for the primary use of a touchscreen-based computer at the Army Corps of Engineers at Carter's Lake Visiting Center. It can be played on any low-end computer with or without touchscreen capabilities. The overarching goal for this game was to teach children ages 8-14 the importance of water safety through a short interactive game. Our primary requirements were for the game to be low poly and have a 360-view camera. 

In the playable section, The user can navigate between 3 sections which include a lake, a beachfront, and a dock. Within each section, the user can click on different NPCs that are highlighted in red. This will bring up a menu that includes a question and three answers. Selecting the correct answers gives the user points and selecting the incorrect answers lowers the points of which that NPC will provide when answered correctly. After the time limit or answering all questions correctly, the user will be sent to a congratulations page in which they can see every question they got incorrect or correct and see an explanation as to the reason for the correct answer. On this page, the User can then view a leaderboard pertaining  the top 15 scores on that system.
